# Locveil board — the cross-repo initiative ledger (PROD-N)

The D-4/D-5 board (`docs/design/productization.md`). One entry per cross-repo initiative,
stable ID `PROD-N`, referenced in commit messages (`PROD-3: …`).

## Conventions

- **A cross-repo idea = a PROD task; the deliverable is a design doc.** Placement rule: a
  design defining a concept/contract both products consume lives in this repo's
  `docs/design/`; a design whose primary artifact is one repo's code lives in that repo's
  `docs/design/`, even when the session ran here.
- **Board-as-outbox (D-5):** on completion a PROD task *delegates* — the delegation text is
  committed in the entry below (this repo is co-owned ground; both product repos may write
  here). The receiving repo's session pulls the delegation, verifies it per its own
  `task-start-reconciliation`, files it under a local ID, and **writes that ID back into the
  entry**. Nothing lives uncommitted in a sibling working tree.
- **The board never asserts a delegated task's status** — per-repo ledgers own status. An
  entry lists delegated IDs; it closes when its own commons-side deliverable is done and all
  delegations have local IDs written back.
- Statuses: `[ ]` open · `[>]` in progress · `[x]` done. Session notes go to
  `JOURNAL.md` (newest on top), not here.
- **IMPL-N (HK-10, 2026-07-14):** implementation work genuinely on commons (regime-2/3
  code under `packages/`, `site/`, `eval/`) that is not itself a cross-repo initiative
  lives under `## IMPL`. PROD stays cross-repo initiatives; HK stays council topics.
- **Ledger discipline (HK-1 / PROD-13, normative: `process/ledger-discipline.md`):** this
  board is the active ledger; completed entries MOVE to `BOARD_DONE.md` in the same change
  as their journal entry. Council topics carry the `HK-N` prefix; being born-decided they
  file directly into `BOARD_DONE.md` (a deferred council parks its HK entry here). Guarded
  by scope-guard (`packages/scope-guard/`, config `.scope-guard.toml`).

## Ledger

Completed entries live in `BOARD_DONE.md` (moved on close; `process/ledger-discipline.md`).

## PROD — cross-repo initiatives

- [ ] **PROD-4 — Deployment coordination + ops conformance** (REFRAMED by council HK-7,
      2026-07-12 — was "Normative ops spec", D-12; the spec stays the deliverable, the
      scope now owns the deployment-coordination pain the owner called "a mess"). Scope:
      (1) ONE compose story with real startup order across the three WB7 containers —
      voice **BUILD-28**, whose own "seeded when BUILD-21 lands" trigger is finally
      discharged here; (2) the normative spec in `process/` codifying the converged
      pattern (sdcard clone update-time-only, `/mnt/data/<name>-config`, repo-owns-config
      sync, `.env` secrets, systemd oneshot, GHCR pull-not-build, log rotation, local
      healthchecks) + a conformance checklist — RECONCILING the stale claims the
      cancelled 2026-07-11 council round inventoried (units require more than the old
      text listed; start-period is dialect not constant; `.env` lives in the runtime
      tree); (3) the **readiness contract** as a named dependency: health-gated ordering
      requires voice ARCH-45 (`/health` reports healthy during ~90s model warmup today) —
      the contract (what compose waits on, per container) is decided HERE, the
      `/health`/`/ready` implementations stay repo-owned; (4) the
      **config-master→deployment-profiles reconciliation convention** (BUILD-31's
      still-unfiled lesson), dialect-aware — voice's TOML master/profiles need the gate,
      bridge's `config-master-tree` is canonical as-is and needs none
      *(AMENDED by the PROD-24 council, 2026-07-14: the "bridge needs none" claim is
      falsified — Workbench controller write APIs put bridge IN scope; the org-wide
      master↔staged reconciliation convention (staged proposals + explicit human
      promotion, dev-phase shape decided at PROD-24, final form deferred to a further
      productization step) is owned HERE; the auth posture for those write APIs is also
      decided here — PROD-24's binding condition: no write API ships before it)*; (5) **secrets
      posture joins** (HK-7 q3): bridge **CORE-8** (committed broker password is in git
      history — rotation is a near-term op) and voice confirms its own exposure class at
      intake. Shared *scripts* only at the third consumer (rule of three). Delegations:
      voice — BUILD-18 (narrowed conformance pass, stands), BUILD-28 (re-point at intake
      to this entry), ARCH-45 dependency noted in its design, NEW local task for the
      master→profiles gate mechanism (voice files it regardless of this entry's pace;
      write the ID back). Voice write-back — lead ID: **BUILD-18** + BUILD-28 (+ gate
      task ID pending). Bridge — OPS-15 (stands), CORE-8 (joins: secrets posture +
      the rotation op). Bridge write-back — lead ID: **OPS-15** + CORE-8.
- [ ] **PROD-9 — Landing page + first suite manifest** (D-11/D-12): `site/` on GitHub Pages
      at `locveil.com` — joint story, per-product blurbs, honest quickstart, routing only
      (never duplicates per-repo reference docs); the calver suite manifest ("Locveil
      2026.xx = voice vX + bridge vY + contract vZ + images …", gated on the cross-suites
      passing against exactly those pins) is its "current release" section. Unblocked by
      PROD-1.
- [ ] **PROD-11 — FUTURE design: Home Assistant in parallel to Wirenboard** (D-4's stress
      test): if the canonical DeviceCommand contract survives HA unchanged, voice gets zero
      tasks; if voice needs changes, the contract leaked WB-specifics. Waits until wanted.
- [ ] **PROD-18 — Catalog contract evolution, round 1** (HK-7 cluster B — the two
      designs that self-declared board-bound before the board existed). Members: bridge
      **VWB-33** (language-data contribution convention — catalog nouns/aliases vs voice
      donation verbs; convention prose may land in commons `process/`; binds voice's
      donation schema, a config-ui surface) + **VWB-34** (confirmation-timing published
      in the contract; the tier-3 async-job pattern is a real API redesign touching
      voice + UI). Voice seat/first consumer: **QUAL-82** (AC louver control, gated on
      VWB-33). **Binding condition (bridge):** one design arc, ONE batched golden/openapi
      cut, ONE voice re-pin — never two. Delegations: bridge — VWB-33 + VWB-34 intake
      reconciliation (their pre-board "once the board lands" wording converts to this
      entry's reference). Bridge write-back — lead ID: **VWB-33** + VWB-34. Voice —
      QUAL-82 gains the PROD-18 gate reference. Voice ID: **QUAL-82**.
- [ ] **PROD-19 — Intake consolidation: one door, locveil-reports** (HK-7 cluster C):
      retire the last pre-board public-issue intake channel; all problem/feature intake
      flows through the locveil-reports pipeline (`report-protocol-v1`). Delegations:
      voice — **BUILD-14**, RECONCILE at intake (the uncommitted-filing mechanism is
      retired; `wb-user-reports` is now `locveil/locveil-reports`). Voice ID:
      **BUILD-14**. Bridge — file the twin AT intake (HK-7 finding: BUILD-14's "the
      bridge repo has the same question" claim had no bridge task behind it). Bridge
      ID: **OPS-28** (written back 2026-07-14; reconciled — no pre-board machinery on
      the bridge side, but the public Issues tab is enabled bare; posture decided
      jointly with BUILD-14).
- [ ] **PROD-20 — Satellite first-light chain (visibility entry, HW-GATED)** (HK-7 q6,
      owner ruling: light PROD). The coupled multi-repo burst that fires when the
      satellite's first conforming descriptor reaches the bridge: satellite descriptor
      (DES-4 lineage) → bridge **DRV-37** (EspManagedDevice implementation, BLOCKED on
      it) → **VWB-39** (descriptor-pin conformance test) → the first deck vocabulary
      contract cut (golden bump) → ONE voice re-pin → config-ui panel. No new local IDs
      now — the members exist and per-deck tasks stay unfiled until first light BY
      DESIGN; the chain executes repo-to-repo per convention; this entry exists so the
      burst lands SEEN, not as a surprise. Closes when the first chain completes
      end-to-end and the re-pin is verified. IDs on record: bridge DRV-37 + VWB-39;
      satellite DES-4/FW-1 lineage. HW-GATED — no timing asserted.
- [ ] **PROD-27 — Logging-scheme extraction (OPTIONAL — spun off from PROD-8 at its
      close, owner ruling 2026-07-18)** (D-8's second leaf, parked by the PROD-8 council:
      "loader first, logging a later round"). Scope when activated: extract the shared
      logging scheme — bridge **OPS-12** (DONE) is the authored reference implementation,
      voice **BUG-30** is the hand-copy it retires (voice-side task: parked **ARCH-43**;
      bridge-side cleanup: OPS-14). Home: `packages/core-py` (second module beside
      `entry_point_loader.py`), tag = a `core-py-vX` minor/major per surface impact, strict
      pin + byte-identity consumption exactly like the loader (the ARCH-58/CORE-7 shape is
      the template). Rule-of-two is already satisfied in principle (the hand-copy pair IS
      two consumers) — this entry is OPTIONAL and trigger-driven, not queued: activate on
      owner interest, the next logging-shape pain in either repo, or a third consumer
      (satellite firmware logging is NOT one — different runtime). No delegations until
      activated; design-then-implement applies (ARCH-43 un-parks as the design task).
