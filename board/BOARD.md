# Locveil board — the cross-repo initiative ledger (PROD-N)

The D-4/D-5 board (`docs/design/productization.md`). One entry per cross-repo initiative,
stable ID `PROD-N`, referenced in commit messages (`PROD-3: …`).

## Conventions

- **A cross-repo idea = a PROD task; the deliverable is a design doc.** Placement rule: a
  design defining a concept/contract both products consume lives in this repo's
  `docs/design/`; a design whose primary artifact is one repo's code lives in that repo's
  `docs/design/`, even when the session ran here.
- **Board-as-outbox (D-5):** on completion a PROD task *delegates* — the delegation text is
  committed in the entry below (this repo is co-owned ground; both product repos may write
  here). The receiving repo's session pulls the delegation, verifies it per its own
  `task-start-reconciliation`, files it under a local ID, and **writes that ID back into the
  entry**. Nothing lives uncommitted in a sibling working tree.
- **The board never asserts a delegated task's status** — per-repo ledgers own status. An
  entry lists delegated IDs; it closes when its own commons-side deliverable is done and all
  delegations have local IDs written back.
- Statuses: `[ ]` open · `[>]` in progress · `[x]` done. Session notes go to
  `JOURNAL.md` (newest on top), not here.
- **Ledger discipline (HK-1 / PROD-13, normative: `process/ledger-discipline.md`):** this
  board is the active ledger; completed entries MOVE to `BOARD_DONE.md` in the same change
  as their journal entry. Council topics carry the `HK-N` prefix; being born-decided they
  file directly into `BOARD_DONE.md` (a deferred council parks its HK entry here). Guarded
  by scope-guard (`packages/scope-guard/`, config `.scope-guard.toml`).

## Ledger

Completed entries live in `BOARD_DONE.md` (moved on close; `process/ledger-discipline.md`).

## PROD — cross-repo initiatives

- [ ] **PROD-4 — Normative ops spec** (D-12) in `process/`: the converged pattern (sdcard
      clone update-time-only, `/mnt/data/<name>-config`, repo-owns-config rsync, `.env`
      secrets, systemd oneshot `RequiresMountsFor=/mnt/data` ONLY, GHCR pull-not-build, log
      rotation, 127.0.0.1 healthchecks, start-period > fleet boot) + a conformance checklist.
      Shared *scripts* only at the third consumer (rule of three). Delegates on completion:
      voice BUILD-18 (narrowed) + bridge OPS-15.
- [ ] **PROD-7 — Contract tagging + scripted re-pin** (D-11): bridge tags `contract-vN`
      releases with artifacts (bridge VWB-29, filed at intake); voice gets `make repin
      CONTRACT=vN` + staleness gate (voice BUILD-24). Commons side: none beyond this entry —
      write local IDs back when the sessions pick them up. Bridge ID: VWB-29 (intake filed
      2026-07-08, uncommitted-mechanism last use). Voice ID: BUILD-24.
- [ ] **PROD-8 — core-py bootstrap + first two extractions** (D-8): `packages/core-py`
      skeleton (own pyproject, `core-py-vX` tags), then the two designs — dynamic code
      loader (voice ARCH-42; voice consumer #1, bridge #2 via CORE-7) and logging scheme
      (voice ARCH-43; retires the BUG-30/OPS-12 hand-copy → bridge OPS-14).
- [ ] **PROD-9 — Landing page + first suite manifest** (D-11/D-12): `site/` on GitHub Pages
      at `locveil.com` — joint story, per-product blurbs, honest quickstart, routing only
      (never duplicates per-repo reference docs); the calver suite manifest ("Locveil
      2026.xx = voice vX + bridge vY + contract vZ + images …", gated on the cross-suites
      passing against exactly those pins) is its "current release" section. Unblocked by
      PROD-1.
- [ ] **PROD-10 — ui-kit package + stylebook** (D-8/D-9, next release): `packages/ui-kit`
      npm package consumed by both config UIs (`../locveil-voice/config-ui`,
      `../locveil-bridge/ui`); component boundaries keep one-shell-with-plugins reachable —
      no plugin framework before two real plugins exist.
- [ ] **PROD-11 — FUTURE design: Home Assistant in parallel to Wirenboard** (D-4's stress
      test): if the canonical DeviceCommand contract survives HA unchanged, voice gets zero
      tasks; if voice needs changes, the contract leaked WB-specifics. Waits until wanted.

## HK — council topics (parked seeds; born-decided topics go straight to `BOARD_DONE.md`)

- [ ] **HK-5 — contracts in general** (parked seed, 2026-07-12, owner — convene when
      wanted). The versioned cross-repo contract surfaces have multiplied and each grew its
      own dialect: the bridge catalog/canonical-command contract (PROD-7 `contract-vN`
      tagging + scripted re-pin, in flight), commons `report-protocol-vN`, bridge
      `device-integration-v1`, the `scope-vN` process kit, and voice's two satellite-facing
      surfaces that have **no version story yet** (WS wire protocol, wake-word pack).
      Council scope: one general convention — tagging + STAMP artifacts, re-pin mechanics
      and staleness gates, version-reporting surfaces, who owns which direction. Known
      riders: voice **ARCH-47** (WS version stamp + wake-pack pin surface + `register`
      version-reporting — owner decision 2026-07-12: executes WITH this council, not
      standalone; the satellite's interim commit-pin holds until then) and likely the
      generalization of PROD-7's `make repin` pattern.
