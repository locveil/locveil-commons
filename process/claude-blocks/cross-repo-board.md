**Locveil cross-repo: the board.** The repos are SIBLINGS on disk — `../locveil-commons`
(umbrella: board, `process/`, shared packages), `../locveil-voice`, `../locveil-bridge`,
`../locveil-satellite`.
Cross-repo initiatives live at `../locveil-commons/board/BOARD.md` (`PROD-N`; council
topics `HK-N`; completed entries in `BOARD_DONE.md`). Delegations arrive as board-as-outbox
text committed inside a PROD entry: pull it, verify per `task-start-reconciliation`, file
it under a LOCAL task ID, execute locally, then write that ID back into the board entry.
The board never asserts a delegated task's status — this repo's ledger owns it. Direct
operational filings between product repos (bug reports, contract requests) stay
repo-to-repo and don't need the board. Cross-repo design sessions and the council run FROM
locveil-commons (convention: `../locveil-commons/process/council.md`); decisions land on
the board, never in chat.
